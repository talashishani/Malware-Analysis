# Malware-Analysis

The purpose of malware analysis is usually to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion. Your goals will typically be to determine exactly what happened, and to ensure that you’ve located all infected machines and files. When analyzing suspected malware, your goal will typically be to determine exactly what a particular suspect binary can do, how to detect it on your network, and how to measure and contain its damage.

This file containes a Yara Rule to detect the attached malware.

The malware only uses one library, which is MSVBVM60.DLL

The Malware is Portable Executable (PE) and runs on Windows – we know this using the magic
code (MZ)

The executable program is malicious since:  It generates a fake error message and it is obfuscated.

The malware was written in visual basic, there is a delay imports detected, and it was created on December 26th, 2022. 

The malware will be accessing the internet. It seems like that the malware will create a registry key. WScript.Shell is also usually associated with executing shell scripts.

# Static-Analysis

Static malware analysis is the process of analyzing malware without executing it. This can include examining the code and binaries of a program, as well as analyzing metadata such as file headers and other information embedded in the file. The goal of static analysis is to identify malware characteristics, such as the presence of known malicious code or indicators of malicious behavior. It can also be used to determine the functionality of the malware and its potential impact on a system. This method is considered less risky than dynamic analysis, which involves actually running the malware in a controlled environment, but it can be more difficult to extract actionable information from the malware.

# Dynamic-Analysis

Dynamic malware analysis is the process of analyzing malware by executing it in a controlled environment. This method allows for the observation of the malware's behavior, such as network communication and file system changes, as well as the identification of any additional malicious components that may not be visible through static analysis. The goal of dynamic analysis is to identify the full range of the malware's capabilities and its potential impact on a system. This method is considered more risky than static analysis, as the malware could potentially harm the analysis environment, but it can provide more information about the malware's capabilities. There are multiple approaches to dynamic analysis such as sandboxing, virtualization, and dynamic instrumentation.
